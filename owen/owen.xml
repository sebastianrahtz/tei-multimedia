        <head>Strange Meeting</head>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>It seemed that out of battle I escaped</l>
          <l>Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped</l>
          <l>Through granites which titanic wars had groined.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,</l>
          <l>Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.</l>
          <l>Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared</l>
          <l>With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,</l>
          <l>Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless.</l>
          <l>And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,—</l>
          <l>By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>With a thousand pains that vision's face was grained;</l>
          <l>Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,</l>
          <l>And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.</l>
          <l>“Strange friend,” I said, “here is no cause to mourn.”</l>
          <l>“None,” said that other, “save the undone years,</l>
          <l>The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,</l>
          <l>Was my life also; I went hunting wild</l>
          <l>After the wildest beauty in the world,</l>
          <l>Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,</l>
          <pb facs="20f4a.jpg"/>
          <l>But mocks the steady running of the hour,</l>
          <l>And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.</l>
          <l>For by my glee might many men have laughed,</l>
          <l>And of my weeping something had been left,</l>
          <l>Which must die now. I mean the truth untold,</l>
          <l>The pity of war, the pity war distilled.</l>
          <l>Now men will go content with what we spoiled,</l>
          <l>Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.</l>
          <l>They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress.</l>
          <l>None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.</l>
          <l>Courage was mine, and I had mystery,</l>
          <l>Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery:</l>
          <l>To miss the march of this retreating world</l>
          <l>Into vain citadels that are not walled.</l>
          <l>Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels,</l>
          <l>I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,</l>
          <l>Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.</l>
          <l>I would have poured my spirit without stint</l>
          <l>But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.</l>
          <l>Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“I am the enemy you killed, my friend.</l>
          <l>I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned</l>
          <l>Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.</l>
          <l>I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.</l>
          <l>Let us sleep now....”</l>

          <head>1</head>
          <l>Happy are men who yet before they are killed</l>
          <l>Can let their veins run cold.</l>
          <l>Whom no compassion fleers</l>
          <l>Or makes their feet</l>
          <l>Sore on the alleys cobbled with their brothers.</l>
          <l>The front line withers,</l>
          <l>But they are troops who fade, not flowers,</l>
          <l>For poets' tearful fooling:</l>
          <l>Men, gaps for filling:</l>
          <l>Losses, who might have fought</l>
          <l>Longer; but no one bothers.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <head>2</head>
          <l>And some cease feeling</l>
          <l>Even themselves or for themselves.</l>
          <l>Dullness best solves</l>
          <l>The tease and doubt of shelling,</l>
          <l>And Chance's strange arithmetic</l>
          <l>Comes simpler than the reckoning of their shilling.</l>
          <l>They keep no check on armies' decimation.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <head>3</head>
          <l>Happy are these who lose imagination:</l>
          <l>They have enough to carry with ammunition.</l>
          <l>Their spirit drags no pack.</l>
          <l>Their old wounds, save with cold, can not more ache.</l>
          <l>Having seen all things red,</l>
          <l>Their eyes are rid</l>
          <l>Of the hurt of the colour of blood for ever.</l>
          <l>And terror's first constriction over,</l>
          <l>Their hearts remain small-drawn.</l>
          <l>Their senses in some scorching cautery of battle</l>
          <l>Now long since ironed,</l>
          <l>Can laugh among the dying, unconcerned.</l>

          <l>Happy the soldier home, with not a notion</l>
          <l>How somewhere, every dawn, some men attack,</l>
          <l>And many sighs are drained.</l>
          <l>Happy the lad whose mind was never trained:</l>
          <l>His days are worth forgetting more than not.</l>
          <l>He sings along the march</l>
          <l>Which we march taciturn, because of dusk,</l>
          <l>The long, forlorn, relentless trend</l>
          <l>From larger day to huger night.</l>

          <head>5</head>
          <l>We wise, who with a thought besmirch</l>
          <l>Blood over all our soul,</l>
          <l>How should we see our task</l>
          <l>But through his blunt and lashless eyes?</l>
          <l>Alive, he is not vital overmuch;</l>
          <l>Drying, not mortal overmuch;</l>
          <l>Nor sad, nor proud,</l>
          <l>Nor curious at all.</l>
          <l>He cannot tell</l>
          <l>Old men's placidity from his.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <head>6</head>
          <l>But cursed are dullards whom no cannon stuns,</l>
          <l>That they should be as stones.</l>
          <l>Wretched are they, and mean</l>
          <l>With paucity that never was simplicity.</l>
          <l>By choice they made themselves immune</l>
          <l>To pity and whatever moans in man</l>
          <l>Before the last sea and the hapless stars;</l>
          <l>Whatever mourns when many leave these shores;</l>
          <l>Whatever shares</l>
          <l>The eternal reciprocity of tears.</l>

          <l>I, too, saw God through mud,—</l>
          <l>The mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled.</l>
          <l>War brought more glory to their eyes than blood,</l>
          <l>And gave their laughs more glee than shakes a child.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Merry it was to laugh there—</l>
          <l>Where death becomes absurd and life absurder.</l>
          <l>For power was on us as we slashed bones bare</l>
          <l>Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I, too, have dropped off Fear—</l>
          <l>Behind the barrage, dead as my platoon,</l>
          <l>And sailed my spirit surging light and clear</l>
          <l>Past the entanglement where hopes lay strewn;</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And witnessed exultation—</l>
          <l>Faces that used to curse me, scowl for scowl,</l>
          <l>Shine and lift up with passion of oblation,</l>
          <l>Seraphic for an hour; though they were foul.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I have made fellowships—</l>
          <l>Untold of happy lovers in old song.</l>
          <l>For love is not the binding of fair lips</l>
          <l>With the soft silk of eyes that look and long,</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="20f8a.jpg"/>
        <lg>
          <l>By Joy, whose ribbon slips,—</l>
          <l>But wound with war's hard wire whose stakes are strong;</l>
          <l>Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;</l>
          <l>Knit in the webbing of the rifle-thong.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I have perceived much beauty</l>
          <l>In the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight;</l>
          <l>Heard music in the silentness of duty;</l>
          <l>Found peace where shell-storms spouted reddest spate.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Nevertheless, except you share</l>
          <l>With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell,</l>
          <l>Whose world is but the trembling of a flare,</l>
          <l>And heaven but as the highway for a shell,</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>You shall not hear their mirth:</l>
          <l>You shall not come to think them well content</l>
          <l>By any jest of mine. These men are worth</l>
          <l>Your tears. You are not worth their merriment.</l>

          <l>As the stained stones kissed by the English dead.</l>
          <l>Kindness of wooed and wooer</l>
          <l>Seems shame to their love pure.</l>
          <l>O Love, your eyes lose lure</l>

        </lg>

          <l>Your voice sings not so soft,—</l>

          <l>Heart, you were never hot</l>
          <l>Nor large, nor full like hearts made great with shot;</l>
          <l>And though your hand be pale,</l>
          <l>Paler are all which trail</l>
          <l>Your cross through flame and hail:</l>

          <l>We cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare, snow-dazed,</l>
          <l>Deep into grassier ditches. So we drowse, sun-dozed,</l>
          <l>Littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses,</l>
          <l>—Is it that we are dying?</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires, glozed</l>
          <l>With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;</l>
          <l>For hours the innocent mice rejoice: the house is theirs;</l>
          <l>Shutters and doors, all closed: on us the doors are closed,—</l>
          <l>We turn back to our dying.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn;</l>
          <l>Nor ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit.</l>
          <l>For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;</l>
          <l>Therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born,</l>
          <l>For love of God seems dying.</l>

            <l>We have fallen in the dreams the ever-living</l>
            <l>Breathe on the tarnished mirror of the world,</l>
            <l>And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh.</l>

        <lg>
          <l>My soul looked down from a vague height, with Death,</l>
          <l>As unremembering how I rose or why,</l>
          <l>And saw a sad land, weak with sweats of dearth,</l>
          <l>Gray, cratered like the moon with hollow woe,</l>
          <l>And pitted with great pocks and scabs of plagues.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Across its beard, that horror of harsh wire,</l>
          <l>There moved thin caterpillars, slowly uncoiled.</l>
          <l>It seemed they pushed themselves to be as plugs</l>
          <l>Of ditches, where they writhed and shrivelled, killed.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>By them had slimy paths been trailed and scraped</l>
          <l>Round myriad warts that might be little hills.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>From gloom's last dregs these long-strung creatures crept,</l>
          <l>And vanished out of dawn down hidden holes.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>(And smell came up from those foul openings</l>
          <l>As out of mouths, or deep wounds deepening.)</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="20f11a.jpg"/>
        <lg>
          <l>On dithering feet upgathered, more and more,</l>
          <l>Brown strings, towards strings of grey, with bristling spines,</l>
          <l>All migrants from green fields, intent on mire.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Those that were grey, of more abundant spawns,</l>
          <l>Ramped on the rest and ate them and were eaten.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I saw their bitten backs curve, loop, and straighten.</l>
          <l>I watched those agonies curl, lift, and flatten.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Whereat, in terror what the sight might mean,</l>
          <l>I reeled and shivered earthward like a feather.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And Death fell with me, like a deepening moan.</l>
          <l>And He, picking a manner of worm, which half had hid</l>
          <l>Its bruises in the earth, but crawled no further,</l>
          <l>Showed me its feet, the feet of many men,</l>
          <l>And the fresh-severed head of it, my head.</l>

          <l>Halted against the shade of a last hill</l>
          <l>They fed, and eased of pack-loads, were at ease;</l>
          <l>And leaning on the nearest chest or knees,</l>
          <l>Carelessly slept. But many there stood still</l>
          <l>To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,</l>
          <l>Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.</l>
          <l>Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled</l>
          <l>By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge;</l>
          <l>And though the summer oozed into their veins</l>
          <l>Like an injected drug for their bodies' pains,</l>
          <l>Sharp on their souls hung the imminent ridge of grass,</l>
          <l>Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Hour after hour they ponder the warm field</l>
          <l>And the far valley behind, where the buttercups</l>
          <l>Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up;</l>
          <l>When even the little brambles would not yield</l>
          <l>But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing arms.</l>
          <l>They breathe like trees unstirred.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Till like a cold gust thrills the little word</l>
          <pb facs="20f28a.jpg"/>
          <l>At which each body and its soul begird</l>
          <l>And tighten them for battle. No alarms</l>
          <l>Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste,—</l>
          <l>Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced</l>
          <l>The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.</l>
          <l>O larger shone that smile against the sun,—</l>
          <l>Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together</l>
          <l>Over an open stretch of herb and heather</l>
          <l>Exposed. And instantly the whole sky burned</l>
          <l>With fury against them; earth set sudden cups</l>
          <l>In thousands for their blood; and the green slope</l>
          <l>Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Of them who running on that last high place</l>
          <l>Breasted the surf of bullets, or went up</l>
          <l>On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,</l>
          <l>Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,</l>
          <l>Some say God caught them even before they fell.</l>

        <lg>
          <l>But what say such as from existence' brink</l>
          <l>Ventured but drave too swift to sink,</l>

          <l>And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames</l>
          <l>With superhuman inhumanities,</l>
          <l>Long-famous glories, immemorial shames—</l>
          <l>And crawling slowly back, have by degrees</l>

          <l>We'd found an old Boche dug-out, and he knew,</l>
          <l>And gave us hell; for shell on frantic shell</l>
          <l>Lit full on top, but never quite burst through.</l>
          <l>Rain, guttering down in waterfalls of slime,</l>
          <l>Kept slush waist-high and rising hour by hour,</l>
          <l>And choked the steps too thick with clay to climb.</l>
          <l>What murk of air remained stank old, and sour</l>
          <l>With fumes from whizz-bangs, and the smell of men</l>
          <l>Who'd lived there years, and left their curse in the den,</l>
          <l>If not their corpses....There we herded from the blast</l>
          <l>Of whizz-bangs, but one found our door at last,—</l>
          <l>Buffeting eyes and breath, snuffing the candles,</l>
          <l>And thud! flump! thud! down the steep steps came thumping</l>
          <l>And sploshing in the flood, deluging muck,</l>
          <l>The sentry's body; then, his rifle, handles</l>

          <l>He was not blind; in time they'd get all right.</l>
          <l>“I can't,” he sobbed. Eyeballs, huge-bulged like squids',</l>
          <l>Watch my dreams still, — yet I forgot him there</l>
          <l>In posting Next for duty, and sending a scout</l>

          <l>And the wild chattering of his broken teeth,</l>
          <l>Renewed most horribly whenever crumps</l>
          <l>Pummelled the roof and slogged the air beneath,—</l>

          <l>What a smooth floor the ward has! What a rug!</l>
          <l>Who is that talking somewhere out of sight?</l>
          <l>Three flies creeping round the shiny jug...</l>
          <l>“Nurse! Doctor!”—“Yes; all right, all right.”</l>

        <lg>
          <l>But sudden evening muddles all the air.</l>
          <l>There seems no time to want a drink of water.</l>
          <l>Nurse looks so far away. And here and there</l>
          <l>Music and roses burst through crimson slaughter.</l>
          <l>He can't remember where he saw blue sky...</l>
          <l>The trench is narrower. Cold, he's cold; yet hot—</l>
          <l>And there's no light to see the voices by...</l>
          <l>There is no time to ask...he knows not what.</l>

          <l>Sit on the bed. I'm blind, and three parts shell.</l>
          <l>Be careful; can't shake hands now; never shall.</l>
          <l>Both arms have mutinied against me,—brutes.</l>
          <l>My fingers fidget like ten idle brats.</l>
        </lg>

          <l>I tried to peg out soldierly,—no use!</l>
          <l>One dies of war like any old disease.</l>
          <l>This bandage feels like pennies on my eyes.</l>
          <l>I have my medals?—Discs to make eyes close.</l>
          <l>My glorious ribbons?—Ripped from my own back</l>
          <l>In scarlet shreds. (That's for your poetry book.)</l>

          <l>We used to say we'd hate to live dead-old,—</l>
          <l>Yet now...I'd willingly be puffy, bald,</l>

          <l>Little I'd ever teach a son, but hitting,</l>

          <l>Well, that's what I learnt,—that, and making money.</l>

          <l>Your fifty years ahead seem none too many?</l>
          <l>Tell me how long I've got? God! For one year</l>
          <l>To help myself to nothing more than air!</l>
          <l>One Spring! Is one too good to spare, too long?</l>
          <l>Spring wind would work its own way to my lung,</l>

          <l>I'd ask no nights off when the bustle's over,</l>
          <l>Enjoying so the dirt. Who's prejudiced</l>

          <l>Against a grimed hand when his own's quite dust,</l>
          <l>Less live than specks that in the sun-shafts turn,</l>
          <l>Less warm than dust that mixes with arms' tan?</l>
          <l>I'd love to be a sweep, now, black as Town,</l>

          <l>Nosing along at night down some safe rut,</l>
          <l>They find a shell-proof home before they rot.</l>
          <l>Dead men may envy living mites in cheese,</l>
          <l>Or good germs even. Microbes have their joys,</l>
          <l>And subdivide, and never come to death.</l>
          <l>Certainly flowers have the easiest time on earth.</l>
          <l>“I shall be one with nature, herb, and stone”</l>

          <l>He sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark,</l>
          <l>And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,</l>
          <l>Legless, sewn short at elbow. Through the park</l>
          <l>Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn,</l>
          <l>Voices of play and pleasure after day,</l>
          <l>Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>About this time Town used to swing so gay</l>
          <l>When glow-lamps budded in the light blue trees,</l>
          <l>And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,—</l>
          <l>In the old times, before he threw away his knees.</l>
          <l>Now he will never feel again how slim</l>
          <l>Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands.</l>
          <l>All of them touch him like some queer disease.</l>

          <l>There was an artist silly for his face,</l>
          <l>For it was younger than his youth, last year.</l>
          <l>Now, he is old; his back will never brace;</l>
          <l>He's lost his colour very far from here,</l>
          <l>Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry,</l>
          <l>And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race</l>
          <l>And leap of purple spurted from his thigh.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg,</l>
          <l>After the matches, carried shoulder-high.</l>
          <l>It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg,</l>
          <l>He thought he'd better join.—He wonders why.</l>
          <l>Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts,</l>
          <l>That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg,</l>
          <l>Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts</l>
          <l>He asked to join. He didn't have to beg;</l>
          <l>Smiling they wrote his lie: aged nineteen years.</l>
          <l>Germans he scarcely thought of; all their guilt,</l>
          <l>And Austria's, did not move him. And no fears</l>
          <l>Of Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts</l>
          <l>For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes;</l>
          <l>And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears;</l>
          <pb facs="20f44a.jpg"/>
          <l>Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits.</l>
          <l>And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal.</l>
          <l>Only a solemn man who brought him fruits</l>
          <l><hi>Thanked</hi> him; and then inquired about his soul.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes,</l>
          <l>And do what things the rules consider wise,</l>
          <l>And take whatever pity they may dole.</l>
          <l>Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes</l>
          <l>Passed from him to the strong men that were whole.</l>
          <l>How cold and late it is! Why don't they come</l>
          <l>And put him into bed? Why don't they come?</l>

          <l>He'd always show the Hun a brave man's face;</l>
          <l>Father would sooner him dead than in disgrace,—</l>
          <l>Was proud to see him going, aye, and glad.</l>
          <l>Perhaps his mother whimpered how she'd fret</l>
          <l>Until he got a nice safe wound to nurse.</l>
          <l>Sisters would wish girls too could shoot, charge, curse...</l>
          <l>Brothers—would send his favourite cigarette.</l>
          <l>Each week, month after month, they wrote the same,</l>
          <l>Thinking him sheltered in some Y. M. Hut,</l>
          <l>Because he said so, writing on his butt</l>
          <l>Where once an hour a bullet missed its aim.</l>
          <l>And misses teased the hunger of his brain.</l>
          <l>His eyes grew old with wincing, and his hand</l>
          <l>Reckless with ague. Courage leaked, as sand</l>
          <l>From the best sandbags after years of rain.</l>
          <l>But never leave, wound, fever, trench-foot, shock,</l>
          <l>Untrapped the wretch. And death seemed still withheld</l>
          <l>For torture of lying machinally shelled,</l>

          <l>“For,” said the paper, “when this war is done</l>
          <l>The men's first instinct will be making homes.</l>
          <l>Meanwhile their foremost need is aerodomes,</l>
          <l>It being certain war has but begun.</l>
          <l>Peace would do wrong to our undying dead,—</l>
          <l>The sons we offered might regret they died</l>
          <l>If we got nothing lasting in their stead.</l>
          <l>We must be solidly indemnified.</l>
          <l>Though all be worthy Victory which all bought,</l>
          <l>We rulers sitting in this ancient spot</l>
          <l>Would wrong our very selves if we forgot</l>
          <l>The greatest glory will be theirs who fought,</l>
          <l>Who kept this nation in integrity.”</l>
          <l>Nation?—The half-limbed readers did not chafe</l>
          <l>But smiled at one another curiously</l>
          <l>Like secret men who know their secret safe.</l>
          <l>(This is the thing they know and never speak,</l>
          <l>That England one by one had fled to France,</l>
          <l>Not many elsewhere now, save under France.)</l>
          <pb facs="20f34va.jpg"/>
          <l>Pictures of these broad smiles appear each week,</l>
          <l>And people in whose voice real feeling rings</l>
          <l>Say: How they smile! They're happy now, poor things.</l>

          <l>Be slowly lifted up, thou long black arm,</l>
          <l>Great Gun towering towards Heaven, about to curse;</l>
          <l>Sway steep against them, and for years rehearse</l>
          <l>Huge imprecations like a blasting charm!</l>
          <l>Reach at that Arrogance which needs thy harm,</l>
          <l>And beat it down before its sins grow worse.</l>
          <l>Spend our resentment, cannon,—yea, disburse</l>
          <l>Our gold in shapes of flame, our breaths in storm.</l>

        <lg>
          <l>Yet, for men's sakes whom thy vast malison</l>
          <l>Must wither innocent of enmity,</l>
          <l>Be not withdrawn, dark arm, the spoilure done,</l>
          <l>Safe to the bosom of our prosperity.</l>
          <l>But when thy spell be cast complete and whole,</l>
          <l>May God curse thee, and cut thee from our soul!</l>

          <l>Out there, we've walked quite friendly up to Death,—</l>
          <l>Sat down and eaten with him, cool and bland,—</l>
          <l>Pardoned his spilling mess-tins in our hand.</l>
          <l>We've sniffed the green thick odour of his breath,—</l>
          <l>Our eyes wept, but our courage didn't writhe.</l>
          <l>He's spat at us with bullets and he's coughed</l>
          <l>Shrapnel. We chorussed when he sang aloft,</l>
          <l>We whistled while he shaved us with his scythe.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Oh, Death was never enemy of ours!</l>
          <l>We laughed at him, we leagued with him, old chum.</l>
          <l>No soldier's paid to kick against His powers.</l>
          <l>We laughed, —knowing that better men would come,</l>
          <l>And greater wars: when each proud fighter brags</l>
          <l>He wars on Death, for lives; not men, for flags.</l>

          <l>The flourish of loud clouds, the Chariot Throne;</l>
          <l>After the drums of time have rolled and ceased,</l>
          <l>And by the bronze west long retreat is blown,</l>
          <l>Shall Life renew these bodies? Of a truth,</l>
          <l>All death will he annul, all tears assuage?</l>
          <l>Or fill these void veins full again with youth,</l>
          <l>And wash, with an immortal water, age?</l>

          <l>Mine ancient scars shall not be glorified,</l>
          <l>Nor my titanic tears, the seas, be dried.”</l>

          <l>Budging the sluggard ripples of the Somme,</l>
          <l>A barge round old Cérisy slowly slewed.</l>
          <l>Softly her engines down the current screwed,</l>
          <l>And chuckled softly with contented hum,</l>
          <l>Till fairy tinklings struck their croonings dumb.</l>
          <l>The waters rumpling at the stern subdued;</l>
          <l>The lock-gate took her bulging amplitude;</l>
          <l>Gently from out the gurgling lock she swum.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>One reading by that calm bank shaded eyes</l>
          <l>To watch her lessening westward quietly.</l>
          <l>Then, as she neared the bend, her funnel screamed.</l>
          <l>And that long lamentation made him wise</l>
          <l>How unto Avalon, in agony,</l>
          <l>Kings passed in the dark barge, which Merlin dreamed.</l>

          <l>My arms have mutinied against me, — brutes!</l>
          <l>My fingers fidget like ten idle brats,</l>
          <l>My back's been stiff for hours, damned hours.</l>
          <l>Death never gives his squad a Stand-at-ease.</l>
          <l>I can't read. There: it's no use. Take your book.</l>
          <l>A short life and a merry one, my buck!</l>
          <l>We said we'd hate to grow dead-old. But now,</l>
          <l>Not to live old seems awful: not to renew</l>
          <l>My boyhood with my boys, and teach 'em hitting,</l>
          <l>Shooting and hunting, — and all the arts of hurting!</l>
          <l>— Well, that's what I learnt. That, and making money.</l>
          <l>Your fifty years in store seem none too many,</l>
          <l>But I've five minutes. God! For just two years</l>
          <l>To help myself to this good air of yours!</l>
          <l>One Spring! Is one too hard to spare? Too long?</l>
          <l>Spring air would find its own way to my lung,</l>
          <l>And grow me legs as quick as lilac-shoots.</l>

          <l>Yes, there's the orderly. He'll change the sheets</l>
          <l>When I'm lugged out. Oh, couldn't I do that?</l>
          <l>Here in this coffin of a bed, I've thought</l>
          <l>I'd like to kneel and sweep his floors for ever, —</l>
          <l>And ask no nights off when the bustle's over,</l>
          <l>For I'd enjoy the dirt. Who's prejudiced</l>
          <l>Against a grimed hand when his gun's quite dust, —</l>
          <l>Less live than specks that in the sun-shafts turn?</l>
          <l>Dear dust — in rooms, on roads, on faces' tan!</l>
          <l>I'd love to be a sweep's boy, black as Town;</l>
          <l>Yes, or a muck-man. Must I be his load?</l>
          <l>A flea would do. If one chap wasn't bloody,</l>
          <l>Or went stone-cold, I'd find another body.</l>

        <lg>
          <l>Which I shan't manage now. Unless it's yours.</l>
          <l>I shall stay in you, friend, for some few hours.</l>
          <l>You'll feel my heavy spirit chill your chest,</l>
          <l>And climb your throat, on sobs, until it's chased</l>
          <l>On sighs, and wiped from off your lips by wind.</l>
          <l>I think on your rich breathing, brother, I'll be weaned</l>
          <l>To do uithout what blood remained me from my wound.</l>
